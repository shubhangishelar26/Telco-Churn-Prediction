# Telco-Churn-Prediction
Project Summary:

This Telco Churn Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn in the telecommunications industry. By analyzing historical customer data, the model can identify potential churners, allowing proactive customer retention strategies to be implemented.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is carefully preprocessed to handle missing values, convert data types, and remove irrelevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations are used to gain insights into the data, understand the distribution of features, and identify patterns related to churn.
Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors are evaluated and compared.
Performance Evaluation: The models are evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Learning curves are also plotted to assess the models' performance.
Feature Engineering: Feature engineering techniques are applied to enhance the predictive power of the models, improving their ability to capture churn patterns.
Model Deployment: The chosen model is deployed to predict customer churn on unseen data, providing a reliable tool for identifying customers at risk of churning.
GitHub Repository: The complete project, including the dataset, code, and documentation, is available in the GitHub repository for further exploration and replication.
By leveraging the power of machine learning, this Telco Churn Prediction project offers valuable insights and actionable information to telecom companies aiming to reduce customer churn rates and improve customer retention strategies.
